# 02 - Lab setup (VirtualBox)

1. Create two VMs: "UbuntuServer" and "KaliLinux".
2. For each VM: allocate 2+ GB RAM and 20+ GB disk.
3. Network: use Bridged Adapter if you want VMs to be reachable from your host. For safer isolation, use Host-only adapter.
4. (Optional) Install Guest Additions for better integration.
