# 07 - Advanced WAF features

Explore:
- HTTP flood protection: configure thresholds and test using `ab` or `siege` tools.
- Authentication sign-in: enable auth gateway for the application in WAF.
- Custom deny rules: block attacker IPs.

Keep notes of thresholds you change so you can revert them later.
